          I first saw Jonathan in my IT for Supply Chains class. Of course, I didn’t know his name, I just thought he was really cute. He was quiet and neatly put together,  and  most importantly, he kept looking at me. We even made eye contact a few times.
          <br><br>
          I became obsessed. I needed to know who he was. I asked one of my well-connected friends to help me find him by  looking through the list of people in the class and looking them up together on Facebook. But he wasn’t there. I was intrigued. Who was this mysterious cute supply chain boy?*
          <br><br>
          After a month of waiting for him to make a move, I decided to say something. The day after valentine’s day (I’m strategic), I ran up to him after class and just said “hi”. He turned around, took out an airpod, and said “hi.” “What’s your name?” “Jonathan, you?” We made some small talk. I learned he was a senior, and studying supply chain, and then I had to head to another class.
          <br><br>
          But he didn’t ask me for my number! I was so embarrassed. I thought I had just made a fool of myself and incorrectly assumed he was looking at me, when maybe he was just looking at the clock the whole time.
          <br><br>
          At that time, I didn’t have facebook or instagram, so I decided to look him up on… LinkedIn. I never checked LinkedIn. But I’m so glad I did that day because Jonathan actually sent ME a message! He said he wanted to redo his intro (cute) and restated his major (also cute). I laughed and asked him to get coffee.
          <br><br>
          We started dating two weeks later. And  here we are, two years later, getting married.
          <br><br>
          *If you’re wondering why he wasn’t in my class list, it’s because the class was cross-listed as both an MIS class and a Supply Chain class. I only had the list of people taking the “MIS” version of the class. Probably only weirdos like me notice this though.
        </p>

        <p id="jonathan-text" class="font-body center-p hidden">
          It started, as most love stories do, in the final required elective course needed to graduate: Information Technology for Supply Chains.
          <br><br>
          I can remember from the very first day of class seeing a cute girl about 8-10 people away from me, sitting in the same row as me. I remember sneaking glances at her — and occasionally having her catch me looking.
          <br><br>
          I was quiet in the class. I was mostly there to clock in, clock out, receive good grades, and just generally get through the course and get the degree. The class itself would have been boring — except for the excitement of seeing this cute girl and maybe having fate put us into groups, or else otherwise shuffling us into a conversation. But the thought of me approaching this beautiful stranger rarely crossed me mind! I didn’t think she could ever see something in me, a quiet, nerdy guy who raised his hand too much to answer questions during class.
          <br><br>
          As class ended one day, I slipped my headphones in and started walking out of the Graduate School of Business — until I felt a tap on my shoulder, turned around, and lost the ability to speak in complete sentences. It was the girl!
          <br><br>
          She introduced herself as Anna. I think I managed to say my name. I also believe I asked how she was liking the class we had both left — really killing it in the small talk department, as always. She answered. The whole time, we were still walking away from the business school. Finally, she said that her next class was actually at the business school and she needed to go back. I managed to say something along the lines of “good to meet you, have fun, see you in class”, and continued walking back to my apartment in a growing state of bewilderment.
          <br><br>
          Conspiracy theories began flowing — had I just been pranked? Was there a hidden camera? Had someone bet $5 that she wouldn’t talk to the quiet guy in class?
          <br><br>
          Clarity slowly swooped in, with the help of Josh Collins and Rylan Veigel: this girl clearly liked me!
          <br><br>
          The roller coaster of a day swung from bewilderment to jubilee — except I didn’t ask for her phone number. I had no way of finding her.
          <br><br>
          I stewed on how to best continue the conversation in the next class session for the rest of the day, until a little liquid inspiration during dinner helped give me an idea: LinkedIn! All business students were required to make one. And surely I could find her there!
          <br><br>
          I pulled up LinkedIn, searched her name, and sure enough found her: MIS, McCombs, same graduation year as me. And with a few more hours of thinking about how to appear calm, collected, and cool to a beautiful young woman like Anna, I typed:
          <br><br>
          <img src="/img/linkedin.png">
          <br><br>
          Which led to coffee, which led to a year and a half of dating, which led to a proposal, which led to this beautiful, amazing, intelligent, kind, and funny soul being my wife.
